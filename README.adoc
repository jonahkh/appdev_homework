[[welcome-to-minishift]]
== Welcome to Minishift!

Minishift is a tool that helps you run OpenShift locally by running a
single-node OpenShift cluster inside a VM. You can try out OpenShift or
develop with it, day-to-day, on your local host.

Minishift uses https://github.com/docker/machine/tree/master/libmachine[libmachine] for
provisioning VMs, and https://github.com/openshift/origin[OpenShift Origin] for running the cluster.

is provisioned. Make sure that the hypervisor of your choice is installed and enabled on
your system before you start Minishift.

For detailed installation instructions for Minishift and the required dependencies, see
the https://docs.openshift.org/latest/minishift/getting-started/index.html[Getting started] documentation.
